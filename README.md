# About

This web application was done with Jonas Schmedtmann guidance and support through his **React** course.

# The project: The wild oasis

The wild oasis is a small boutique **hotel** with 8 luxurious wooden cabins(Fictional, for the course). They need a custom-built applicationto manage everything about the hotel: **bookings**, **cabins** and **guests**.

This is an **internal application** used inside the hotal to **check in guests as they arrive**.

They have nothing right now, so they also **need an API**, the API should serve for the **internal management** of the application and for a **custome-facing website to book stays**.
